# Final Recommendation: Using stdout for Important Logs

## Summary of Changes

We've modified the package to use `console.log` instead of `console.error` for important logs to ensure they're visible when the server is launched from Roo. The following changes were made:

1. In `src/app.ts`:
   - Changed all informational log messages from `console.error` to `console.log`
   - Updated comments to reflect the change in logging approach
   - Kept actual error conditions using `console.error`

2. In `src/index.ts`:
   - Changed the server startup message from `console.error` to `console.log`
   - Updated comments to reflect the change in logging approach

3. No changes were made to `src/resources.ts` as it only uses `console.error` for actual error conditions.

## Testing Results

We tested the changes using the `simulate-roo-mcp-local-fixed.js` script, which simulates how Roo would run the MCP server. The results show:

1. Before the changes:
   - Important logs were sent to stderr
   - Roo may not have been capturing or displaying stderr output

2. After the changes:
   - Important logs are now sent to stdout
   - The logs are visible in both direct execution and simulated Roo execution

## Conclusion

The changes we made should ensure that important logs are visible when the server is launched from Roo. By using `console.log` instead of `console.error` for informational messages, we've made sure that these messages will be captured and displayed by Roo, which may only be capturing stdout.

## Recommendations for Future Development

1. **Consistent Logging Approach**: Maintain a consistent approach to logging, using:
   - `console.log` for informational messages that should be visible to users
   - `console.error` only for actual error conditions

2. **Logging Configuration**: Consider implementing a more robust logging system that allows for:
   - Different log levels (debug, info, warn, error)
   - Configuration of where logs are sent (stdout, stderr, file)
   - Filtering of logs based on level

3. **Documentation**: Update documentation to reflect the logging approach used in the package, so that developers understand how to interpret the logs.

4. **Testing**: Continue to test the package with Roo to ensure that logs are visible and that the server functions correctly.

## Next Steps

1. Test the changes with the actual Roo integration to verify that the logs are now visible.
2. Consider implementing a more robust logging system in the future.
3. Update documentation to reflect the logging approach used in the package.
