# Roo MCP Server Launch Analysis - Updated Findings

## Summary of Findings

We've investigated the issue with the MCP server not displaying npm organization logs when launched from Roo. Our analysis reveals the following:

1. **Log Output Stream**: The npm organization logs are being sent to `stderr`, not `stdout`. This is by design in the application code:
   ```typescript
   // In app.ts, line 46
   if (config['npm-org']) {
     console.error(`Using npm organization: ${config['npm-org']}`);
   }
   ```

2. **Local Execution**: When running the server directly with Node.js or with the local package, the npm organization logs are correctly visible in the stderr stream.

3. **NPX Execution in Scripts**: When attempting to run the server with npx in our test scripts, we encounter an error: `sh: ts-pkg-distro: command not found`. However, the user confirmed that the command works when run directly in their terminal.

4. **Binary Permissions**: The binary file (`dist/app.js`) exists and has the correct shebang line (`#!/usr/bin/env node`), but it's not executable (permissions: 100644).

5. **Package Configuration**: The package is published correctly on npm with the bin field set to `ts-pkg-distro`.

## Root Causes

1. **Primary Issue**: Roo may not be capturing or displaying stderr output from MCP servers, only stdout.

2. **Secondary Issue**: There's a difference in how npx commands are executed in our test scripts versus how they're executed in the user's terminal:
   - When run in our scripts, npx is not making the binary executable, resulting in the "command not found" error.
   - When run in the user's terminal, the command works, possibly because:
     - The user has the package installed globally
     - The user's environment is set up differently
     - The user's shell is handling the execution differently

## Execution Flow Analysis

When npx runs a package with a bin field, it should:
1. Download the package to a temporary directory
2. Make the binary executable
3. Add the binary to the PATH
4. Execute the binary

In our case, step 2 seems to be failing when run from our scripts, but working when run from the user's terminal.

## Recommendations

1. **For Roo Integration**:
   - Ensure Roo captures and displays both stdout and stderr from MCP servers
   - Consider merging stderr and stdout streams for display purposes
   - Add logging to show how Roo is executing the MCP server (command line used)
   - Ensure Roo is using the correct environment variables and shell configuration

2. **For Package Implementation**:
   - Consider using `console.log` instead of `console.error` for important information that should be visible to users
   - Add a configuration option to control whether logs go to stdout or stderr
   - Implement a unified logging mechanism that works consistently across different execution methods
   - Ensure the binary is made executable in the prepare script:
     ```json
     "prepare": "npm run build && chmod +x dist/app.js"
     ```

3. **For NPX Execution**:
   - When executing npx commands in Roo, consider using `shell: true` to match how the user would run the command in their terminal
   - Ensure the correct environment variables are being passed to the npx command
   - Consider using `npm exec` instead of `npx` as it might handle binary permissions differently

## Next Steps

1. Modify Roo to capture and display stderr output from MCP servers
2. Update the package to use a more consistent logging approach
3. Investigate why npx behaves differently in scripts versus in the user's terminal

## Testing Methodology

We created and ran several test scripts to simulate different execution methods and debug the issue:

1. `simulate-roo-mcp.js`: Simulates running the MCP server with npx (as Roo would)
2. `simulate-roo-mcp-exact.js`: Uses shell: true to run the exact npx command
3. `simulate-roo-mcp-local.js`: Runs the local package directly with the --verbose flag
4. `simulate-roo-mcp-fixed.js`: Modified version that checks both stdout and stderr
5. `simulate-roo-mcp-local-fixed.js`: Modified local version that checks both stdout and stderr
6. `test-npx-direct.js`: Tests if the npx command works directly from the command line
7. `simulate-roo-execution.js`: Simulates how Roo might execute the MCP server
8. `debug-npx-error.js`: Debugs the "command not found" error
9. `debug-npx-process.js`: Debugs the npx process to understand why it can't find the command

These scripts helped us identify that:
1. The npm organization logs are being sent to stderr, not stdout
2. The npx command works in the user's terminal but fails in our test scripts
3. The binary file exists but is not executable
4. The issue is likely with how npx is handling binary permissions when run from our scripts
