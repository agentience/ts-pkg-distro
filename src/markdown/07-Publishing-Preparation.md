# TypeScript Package Setup - Publishing Preparation

This step will prepare your TypeScript package for publishing to npm. Publishing makes your package available for others to install and use.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- npm account created (if you don't have one, you'll create it during this step)
- TypeScript package built and tested (see Build and Test step)

## What This Script Does

1. **Verifies Package Readiness**: Checks for required files and fields
2. **Creates or Logs in to npm Account**: Ensures you're logged in to npm
3. **Prepares Documentation**: Creates or updates README.md with essential information
4. **Adds License**: Creates a LICENSE file if needed
5. **Updates Version**: Optionally updates the package version

## Manual Preparation (if needed)

If you prefer to prepare your package manually:

1. **Verify package.json**: Make sure it has all the required fields
2. **Create or update README.md**: Add detailed documentation
3. **Add a LICENSE file**: Choose an appropriate license
4. **Log in to npm**: Run `npm login`
5. **Update version**: Run `npm version patch|minor|major`

## Pre-Publishing Checklist

Before proceeding to publishing, ensure you have:

- [ ] All required fields in package.json
- [ ] Built the package with TypeScript declarations
- [ ] Clear and complete documentation in README.md
- [ ] Appropriate license in LICENSE file and package.json
- [ ] Logged in to npm
- [ ] Appropriate version number

## Next Steps

After completing the Publishing Preparation, proceed to:

1. **Publishing to npm** - To publish your package to npm
