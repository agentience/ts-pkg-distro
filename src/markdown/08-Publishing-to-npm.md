# TypeScript Package Setup - Publishing to npm

This final step will publish your TypeScript package to npm, making it available for others to install and use.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- npm account created and logged in
- TypeScript package built, tested, and prepared for publishing (see previous steps)

## Publishing to npm Script

## Publishing Process

### 1. Final Checks

Before publishing, the script performs several checks:

- Verifies you're logged in to npm
- Checks for README.md and LICENSE files
- Runs tests if available
- Checks package size and TypeScript declarations

### 2. Publishing

The publishing command depends on whether your package is scoped:

- For regular packages: `npm publish`
- For scoped packages (e.g., @yourscope/package-name): `npm publish --access public`

### 3. Post-Publishing

After publishing, you can:

- Add an npm version badge to your README
- Set up CI/CD for automated publishing
- Share your package with the community

## Manual Publishing (if needed)

If you prefer to publish manually:

1. Make sure you're logged in to npm:
   ```bash
   npm login
   ```

2. Run final checks:
   ```bash
   # Run tests
   npm test
   
   # Check package size
   npm pack --dry-run
   ```

3. Publish the package:
   ```bash
   # For regular packages
   npm publish
   
   # For scoped packages
   npm publish --access public
   ```

## Updating Your Package

When you want to update your package in the future:

1. Make your code changes
2. Run tests: `npm test`
3. Update the version: `npm version patch|minor|major`
4. Publish the updated package: `npm publish`

## Using the npm-org Configuration Option

The package supports an `npm-org` configuration option that determines whether your package is published with an organization namespace or not. This simplifies the publishing process, especially when using CI/CD.

### How It Works

1. Add the `npm-org` option to your `mcp-config.json` file:
   ```json
   {
     "server": {
       "name": "Your-Package-Name",
       "version": "1.0.0"
     },
     "npm-org": "your-org-name"
   }
   ```

2. When publishing:
   - If `npm-org` is specified, the package will be published with the organization namespace (e.g., `@your-org-name/package-name`) and the `--access public` flag will be automatically applied
   - If `npm-org` is not specified, the package will be published without an organization namespace

3. Benefits:
   - Consistent package naming across development and CI/CD environments
   - Automatic handling of the `--access public` flag for scoped packages
   - Simplified configuration management for projects with multiple packages

## CI/CD Integration

The script can set up CI/CD using GitHub Actions for automated publishing. This requires:

1. A GitHub repository for your package
2. An npm token: `npm token create`
3. Adding the token as a secret in your GitHub repository settings with the name `NPM_TOKEN`
4. Creating a new release in GitHub to trigger the workflow

The CI/CD workflow automatically detects the `npm-org` configuration and adjusts the package name and publishing command accordingly:

```yaml
# Determine if we need to use an npm organization
- name: Check for npm organization config
  id: npm-org-check
  run: |
    if [ -f mcp-config.json ]; then
      NPM_ORG=$(node -e "try { const config = require('./mcp-config.json'); console.log(config['npm-org'] || ''); } catch(e) { console.log(''); }")
      echo "NPM_ORG=$NPM_ORG" >> $GITHUB_ENV
      echo "Found npm-org in config: $NPM_ORG"
    fi

# Publish with or without organization namespace
- name: Publish package
  run: |
    if [ -n "$NPM_ORG" ]; then
      # Update package.json name to include organization
      node -e "const fs = require('fs'); const pkg = require('./package.json'); pkg.name = '@${{ env.NPM_ORG }}/' + pkg.name.replace(/^@.*\//, ''); fs.writeFileSync('./package.json', JSON.stringify(pkg, null, 2));"
      echo "Publishing with organization namespace: @${{ env.NPM_ORG }}"
      npm publish --access public
    else
      # Update package.json name to remove organization if present
      node -e "const fs = require('fs'); const pkg = require('./package.json'); if (pkg.name.startsWith('@')) { pkg.name = pkg.name.replace(/^@.*\//, ''); fs.writeFileSync('./package.json', JSON.stringify(pkg, null, 2)); }"
      echo "Publishing without organization namespace"
      npm publish
    fi
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! Your TypeScript package is now published to npm and available for others to use. You've successfully completed all the steps required to set up a TypeScript package for distribution.

Remember to maintain your package by addressing issues, adding new features, and updating dependencies. Keep your documentation up to date and respond to community feedback.

Happy coding!
