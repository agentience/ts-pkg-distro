# TypeScript Package Setup - Publishing to npm

This final step will publish your TypeScript package to npm, making it available for others to install and use.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- npm account created and logged in
- TypeScript package built, tested, and prepared for publishing (see previous steps)

## Publishing to npm Script

## Publishing Process

### Preferred Method: GitHub Workflows

For projects using Git with a GitHub repository, the recommended approach is to publish through GitHub Actions workflows rather than direct npm publishing. This provides several advantages:

- Automated, consistent publishing process
- No need to handle npm authentication locally
- Version control integration
- Audit trail of all published versions
- Ability to trigger releases through GitHub's UI

If your project has a GitHub repository, follow these steps:

1. Ensure your project has a GitHub workflow file at `.github/workflows/publish.yml`
2. Set up the required npm token as a GitHub secret
3. Create a GitHub release to trigger the workflow

Detailed instructions are provided in the [CI/CD Integration](#cicd-integration) section below.

### Alternative: Manual Publishing

If you prefer or need to publish manually, follow these steps:

#### 1. Final Checks

Before publishing, perform several checks:

- Verify you're logged in to npm
- Check for README.md and LICENSE files
- Run tests if available
- Check package size and TypeScript declarations

#### 2. Publishing

The publishing command depends on whether your package is scoped:

- For regular packages: `npm publish`
- For scoped packages (e.g., @yourscope/package-name): `npm publish --access public`

#### 3. Post-Publishing

After publishing, you can:

- Add an npm version badge to your README
- Share your package with the community

## Manual Publishing (if needed)

If you prefer to publish manually:

1. Make sure you're logged in to npm:
   ```bash
   npm login
   ```

2. Run final checks:
   ```bash
   # Run tests
   npm test
   
   # Check package size
   npm pack --dry-run
   ```

3. Publish the package:
   ```bash
   # For regular packages
   npm publish
   
   # For scoped packages
   npm publish --access public
   ```

## Updating Your Package

When you want to update your package in the future:

1. Make your code changes
2. Run tests: `npm test`
3. Update the version: `npm version patch|minor|major`
4. If using GitHub workflow (recommended):
   - Commit and push your changes
   - Create a new GitHub release to trigger the publishing workflow
5. If publishing manually:
   - Run `npm publish` (or `npm publish --access public` for scoped packages)

## Package Name and Publishing

The package name in your `package.json` file determines how your package will be published to npm. The GitHub Actions workflow will use this name as-is without modifying it.

### How It Works

1. Set your desired package name in `package.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "your-package-name",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     ...
   }
   ```
   
   Or for a scoped package:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "@your-org-name/your-package-name",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     ...
   }
   ```

2. When publishing:
   - If your package name starts with `@` (a scoped package), the `--access public` flag will be automatically applied
   - If your package name doesn't start with `@` (a regular package), it will be published without the `--access public` flag

3. Benefits:
   - Package name in `package.json` is always respected
   - No runtime modifications to your package.json
   - Automatic handling of the `--access public` flag for scoped packages
   - Simplified publishing process for both local and CI/CD environments
   - No dependency on npm-org configuration or NPM_ORG environment variable

## CI/CD Integration

GitHub Actions provides a powerful way to automate the publishing process. Here's how to set it up and use it:

### 1. Setting Up the GitHub Workflow

Create a file at `.github/workflows/publish.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
name: Node.js Package

on:
  release:
    types: [created]
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      version:
        description: 'Version to publish'
        required: true
        default: '1.0.0'

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '16.x'
          registry-url: 'https://registry.npmjs.org/'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
      
      # Check if package name is scoped (starts with @)
      - name: Check if package is scoped
        id: package-check
        run: |
          IS_SCOPED=$(node -e "const pkg = require('./package.json'); console.log(pkg.name.startsWith('@') ? 'true' : 'false');")
          echo "IS_SCOPED=$IS_SCOPED" >> $GITHUB_ENV
          echo "Package name from package.json: $(node -e "console.log(require('./package.json').name)")"
      
      # Publish package based on whether it's scoped or not
      - name: Publish package
        run: |
          if [ "$IS_SCOPED" = "true" ]; then
            echo "Publishing scoped package with --access public"
            npm publish --access public
          else
            echo "Publishing regular package"
            npm publish
          fi
        env:
          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{secrets.NPM_TOKEN}}
```

### 2. Creating an npm Token

Generate an npm token for automated publishing:

```bash
npm login  # If not already logged in
npm token create --read-only=false
```

Copy the generated token.

### 3. Adding the Token to GitHub Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
3. Click "New repository secret"
4. Name: `NPM_TOKEN`
5. Value: Paste the npm token you created
6. Click "Add secret"

### 4. Publishing Using GitHub Releases

To publish a new version:

1. Update your package version in package.json
2. Commit and push your changes
3. Go to your GitHub repository
4. Navigate to Releases
5. Click "Create a new release"
6. Create a new tag in the format `v1.2.0` (matching your package version)
7. Title: `Release v1.2.0`
8. Description: Add your release notes
9. Click "Publish release"

The GitHub workflow will automatically trigger and publish your package to npm.

### 5. Manual Workflow Trigger

You can also manually trigger the workflow:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to Actions > Node.js Package
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Enter the version number
5. Click "Run workflow"

### Benefits of This Approach

This workflow:
- Uses the package name directly from package.json without modification
- Does not require any npm-org configuration
- Does not depend on the NPM_ORG environment variable
- Automatically detects scoped packages and applies the appropriate publishing command
- Provides a consistent, repeatable publishing process
- Creates an audit trail of all published versions

## Conclusion

Congratulations! Your TypeScript package is now published to npm and available for others to use. You've successfully completed all the steps required to set up a TypeScript package for distribution.

Remember to maintain your package by addressing issues, adding new features, and updating dependencies. Keep your documentation up to date and respond to community feedback.

Happy coding!
