# TypeScript Package Distribution - Orchestrator

This orchestrator guides you through the process of setting up a TypeScript package for distribution to npm. Follow these steps sequentially to ensure your package is properly configured, built, and published.

## Overview

Setting up a TypeScript package for distribution involves several steps:

1. **Project Assessment** - Evaluate your current project setup
2. **Initial Setup** - Create the basic project structure
3. **TypeScript Configuration** - Configure TypeScript for package distribution
4. **Package Configuration** - Configure package.json for npm distribution
5. **Executable Setup** (optional) - Make your package executable with npx
6. **Build and Test** - Build your package and test it locally
7. **Publishing Preparation** - Prepare your package for publishing
8. **Publishing to npm** - Publish your package to npm

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Project Assessment

**Purpose**: Assess the current state of your project to determine which setup steps are needed.

**Resource**: `ts-pkg-distro://resource/01-Project-Assessment`

**Run this step to**:
- Check if package.json exists
- Check if TypeScript is installed
- Check if tsconfig.json is configured correctly
- Check if source directory and entry point exist
- Check if .gitignore is set up
- Generate an assessment report for use in subsequent steps

### Step 2: Initial Setup

**Purpose**: Create the basic structure for your TypeScript package.

**Resource**: `ts-pkg-distro://resource/02-Initial-Setup`

**Run this step if**:
- You don't have package.json
- You don't have a src directory
- You don't have .gitignore

**This step will**:
- Create package.json
- Initialize git repository
- Install TypeScript and development tools
- Create source directory and basic entry point
- Set up .gitignore with common entries

### Step 3: TypeScript Configuration

**Purpose**: Configure TypeScript for package distribution.

**Resource**: `ts-pkg-distro://resource/03-TypeScript-Configuration`

**Run this step if**:
- You don't have tsconfig.json
- Your tsconfig.json doesn't have declaration: true
- Your tsconfig.json doesn't have outDir configured

**This step will**:
- Create or update tsconfig.json with recommended settings
- Ensure declaration files (.d.ts) will be generated
- Configure output directory for compiled files

### Step 4: Package Configuration

**Purpose**: Configure package.json for npm distribution.

**Resource**: `ts-pkg-distro://resource/04-Package-Configuration`

**Run this step if**:
- Your package.json doesn't have main field
- Your package.json doesn't have types field
- Your package.json doesn't have files field
- Your package.json doesn't have build or prepare scripts

**This step will**:
- Add main, types, and files fields to package.json
- Add clean, build, prepare, and prepublishOnly scripts
- Add optional metadata like description, keywords, repository, and license

### Step 5: Executable Setup (Optional)

**Purpose**: Make your package executable with npx.

**Resource**: `ts-pkg-distro://resource/05-Executable-Setup`

**Run this step if**:
- You want your package to be executable from the command line with npx
- Your package provides a command-line interface (CLI)

**This step will**:
- Create a CLI entry point with shebang line
- Update tsconfig.json to include the CLI file
- Add bin field to package.json
- Update prepare script to make the CLI file executable

### Step 6: Build and Test

**Purpose**: Build your package and test it locally.

**Resource**: `ts-pkg-distro://resource/06-Build-and-Test`

**Run this step after**:
- Completing the setup and configuration steps

**This step will**:
- Build your TypeScript package
- Verify the build output (JavaScript and declaration files)
- Link the package locally for testing
- Test executable functionality (if applicable)
- Create a test project to test the package as a dependency

### Step 7: Publishing Preparation

**Purpose**: Prepare your package for publishing to npm.

**Resource**: `ts-pkg-distro://resource/07-Publishing-Preparation`

**Run this step after**:
- Building and testing your package

**This step will**:
- Verify package readiness with pre-publishing checks
- Create or log in to npm account
- Prepare documentation (README.md)
- Add license (if needed)
- Update version before publishing

### Step 8: Publishing to npm

**Purpose**: Publish your package to npm.

**Resource**: `ts-pkg-distro://resource/08-Publishing-to-npm`

**Run this step after**:
- Completing all previous steps

**This step will**:
- Perform final checks before publishing
- Publish the package to npm
- Add npm version badge to README (optional)
- Set up CI/CD for automated publishing (optional)
- Provide guidance on maintaining and updating your package

## Using This Guide

1. Start with the Project Assessment step to determine which steps you need to complete
2. Follow each required step in sequence
3. Run the provided scripts or follow the manual instructions for each step
4. After completing all steps, your TypeScript package will be published to npm

## Advanced Configuration

For advanced package configuration, consider:

- Bundling with Rollup for smaller package size
- Adding documentation generation with TypeDoc
- Setting up Changesets for versioning
- Configuring ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- Adding GitHub Actions for CI/CD

## File Structure

A typical TypeScript package structure looks like this:

```
my-typescript-package/
├── .git/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── publish.yml
├── .gitignore
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── dist/                 (generated)
│   ├── index.js
│   ├── index.d.ts
│   └── app.js            (if executable)
├── node_modules/         (not committed)
├── package.json
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts
│   └── app.ts            (if executable)
├── tests/
│   └── index.test.ts
└── tsconfig.json
```

## Conclusion

Following this guide will help you set up a TypeScript package that follows best practices for npm distribution. Your package will be properly configured, built, and published, making it easy for others to install and use.

Happy coding!
