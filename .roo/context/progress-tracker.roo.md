## Known Issues

At this stage in the project, we've identified several potential challenges:

1. **DynamoDB Data Modeling**
   - Complex relationships from relational model will require careful design
   - Need to ensure all access patterns are identified before implementation
   - Some queries may require denormalization trade-offs

2. **Business Logic Translation**
   - Moisture testing calculations need careful verification
   - Workflow state transitions need validation against existing logic
   - Form validation logic needs to be precisely migrated

3. **User Experience Transition**
   - Users will need training on the new interface
   - Some workflows may change in the new system
   - Mobile experience will be significantly different

4. **Integration Points**
   - Any external system integrations need to be identified
   - Email notifications need to be recreated
   - File/document migration requires careful planning

5. **Accelerated Timeline Challenges**
   - Integration complexity due to parallel development streams
   - Potential for technical debt from accelerated pace
   - Resource constraints for expanded team size
   - Maintaining quality while increasing development velocity
