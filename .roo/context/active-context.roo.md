   - Set up alerts for critical operations
   - Implement error handling patterns

### Revised Roadmap

Following the accelerated implementation plan (Phase 1):

1. âœ… **Stage 1: Analysis & Planning** (2 days) - COMPLETED
2. ðŸ”² **Stage 2: Core Development** (8 weeks) - IN PROGRESS
   - âœ… Week 1: Infrastructure Foundation - COMPLETED
   - ðŸ”² Week 2: GraphQL API Design & DynamoDB Modeling - NEXT
   - ðŸ”² Week 3-8: Remaining implementation work
3. ðŸ”² **Stage 3: User Acceptance Testing** (1 week)
4. ðŸ”² **Stage 4: Deployment & Cutover** (1 week)

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Key Decisions Made

1. **Architecture Approach**: Serverless architecture using AWS services with AWS Amplify as the primary development framework.

2. **Technology Stack**:
   - Framework: AWS Amplify for infrastructure, API, and authentication
   - Backend: AWS AppSync GraphQL API with Lambda resolvers
   - Frontend: React with Amplify UI and AWS Cloudscape components
   - Database: DynamoDB with single-table design (OpenSearch Serverless for future advanced search)
   - Authentication: Amazon Cognito with application-level RBAC

3. **Migration Strategy**: Phased migration approach with parallel operation of old and new systems until cutover, rather than a "big bang" replacement.

4. **Data Modeling**: Single-table DynamoDB design with access patterns as the primary consideration, using GSIs for additional query capabilities.

5. **Access Control**: Multi-layered RBAC approach with Cognito groups for role membership and GraphQL directives for permissions.

6. **Timeline Approach**: Accelerated timeline leveraging AWS Amplify and generative AI tools to condense original stages 2-5 into an 8-week core development stage, reducing total remaining time from 26-34 weeks to 10 weeks.

7. **UI Framework Choice**: AWS Cloudscape Design System for consistent, professional user interface components that align with AWS design patterns.

### Open Considerations

1. **Data Migration Approach**:
   - Need to determine if migration will be a one-time process or involve ongoing synchronization
   - Evaluate tools (AWS DMS, custom ETL, etc.) for the migration process
   - Define detailed validation strategy for migrated data

2. **Authentication Migration**:
   - Plan for migrating existing users to Cognito
   - Determine password migration strategy
   - Define role mapping from existing system to new permissions model

3. **Report Generation**:
   - Evaluate serverless options for PDF generation at scale
   - Consider if report templates need redesign
   - Determine approach for historical report access

4. **Field Operation Requirements**:
   - Assess need for offline capabilities for field technicians
   - Evaluate progressive web app vs. native mobile app approach
   - Define sync strategy for intermittent connectivity scenarios

5. **User Training Strategy**:
   - Determine training approach for different user roles
   - Consider phased user migration strategy
   - Plan for documentation and support materials

## Current Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| Complex data migration issues | High | Medium | Thorough testing, dry runs, fallback options |
| Business logic translation errors | High | Medium | Comprehensive test suite, parallel validation |
| User adoption challenges | Medium | Medium | Early user involvement, training, phased rollout |
| Timeline extensions | Medium | High | Daily integration checkpoints, strict change management |
| DynamoDB access pattern limitations | High | Medium | Early POCs, design validation, flexible schema |
| Integration complexity | High | High | Clear API contracts, dedicated integration team, daily integration points |
| Resource constraints | High | Medium | Cross-trained team members, on-demand expertise, AI assistance |
| Technical debt from accelerated pace | Medium | High | Scheduled refactoring post-launch, documentation requirements |

## Open Questions

1. What is the expected volume of data to be migrated (number of projects, size of file attachments, etc.)?
2. Are there any regulatory or compliance requirements that need special consideration?
3. What is the desired approach for handling in-flight projects during the migration period?
4. Are there any upcoming business changes that might affect the migration (new service offerings, organizational changes, etc.)?
5. What are the most critical performance metrics for the new system?
6. What level of quality vs. speed trade-off is acceptable to stakeholders?
7. How much experience does the team have with AWS Amplify and GraphQL?
8. What specific generative AI tools will be adopted for different aspects of development?
9. Which organization-level access patterns are most critical for the multi-tenant approach?
10. At what point in the project would advanced search capabilities via OpenSearch be needed?
