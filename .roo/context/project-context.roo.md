# Project Brief: QCubed to AWS Serverless Migration

## Project Overview

This project involves migrating a legacy QCubed-based moisture testing management application to a modern AWS serverless architecture with a React frontend. The existing application is used for managing concrete moisture testing projects from initiation through completion, including client management, field data collection, analysis, and reporting.

## Core Requirements

1. Analyze the existing QCubed application architecture and database schema
2. Design a modern, serverless architecture using AWS services
3. Create a comprehensive migration plan with phased implementation
4. Develop a data migration strategy from PostgreSQL to DynamoDB
5. Document the existing application functionality and proposed new architecture

## Goals

1. **Modernize Technology Stack**: Replace the legacy QCubed PHP framework with modern, well-supported technologies
2. **Improve Scalability**: Design a cloud-native architecture that can scale with demand
3. **Enhance User Experience**: Create a responsive, intuitive interface that works well for field technicians
4. **Enable Integration**: Develop well-defined APIs for future integration with other systems
5. **Optimize Costs**: Leverage serverless pay-per-use model to reduce operational expenses
6. **Ensure Business Continuity**: Preserve all critical business logic and workflows during migration

## Constraints

1. The existing system must remain operational during the migration
2. All historical data must be preserved and accessible in the new system
3. The complex business logic for moisture testing analysis must be maintained
4. The new system must support all current user roles and permissions

## Success Criteria

1. Complete analysis documentation of the existing application
2. Detailed migration plan with realistic timeline and resource estimates
3. Technical architecture design for the new AWS serverless application
4. Data modeling approach for transitioning from relational to NoSQL database
5. Comprehensive implementation and testing strategy

## Stakeholders

- Project Management Team
- Development Team
- QA Team
- System Administrators
- End Users (Field Technicians, Office Staff)
- Clients (Who receive testing reports)

## Timeline

The initial planning and analysis stage is now complete. The accelerated migration project (Phase 1) is estimated to take approximately 10 weeks across four implementation stages:

1. Analysis & Planning (2 days) - COMPLETED
2. Core Development (8 weeks) - IN PROGRESS
   - Week 1: Infrastructure Foundation - COMPLETED
   - Week 2-8: Remaining development work
3. User Acceptance Testing (1 week)
4. Deployment & Cutover (1 week)

## Implementation Status

### Week 1 Implementation Completed

1. **Authentication Setup** ✅
   - Configured AWS Cognito for user authentication
   - Implemented multi-factor authentication
   - Set up user attributes for organization-based data isolation
   - Defined 6 user roles (Administrators, ProjectManagers, FieldTechnicians, Analysts, Clients, Auditors)

2. **Data Model Implementation** ✅
   - Created single-table DynamoDB design
   - Defined Project, Client, TestData, Document, and User models
   - Implemented relationships between entities
   - Set up authorization rules for role-based access control

3. **Storage Configuration** ✅
   - Configured S3 storage for document management
   - Set up directory structure aligned with organizations and projects
   - Implemented appropriate access controls

4. **Frontend Framework** ✅
   - Set up React application with TypeScript
   - Integrated AWS Cloudscape Design System
   - Created basic UI components (Navigation, Dashboard)
   - Implemented authentication UI with Amplify
