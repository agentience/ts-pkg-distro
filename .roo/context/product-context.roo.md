# Product Context: QCubed to AWS Serverless Migration

## Business Purpose

The IFTI (Independent Floor Testing & Inspection) application is a specialized system for managing concrete moisture testing projects. This system is critical for the business operations as it supports the entire lifecycle of moisture testing services:

1. **Client Engagement**: Managing client/commissioner relationships and project initiation
2. **Project Management**: Tracking projects through various stages of completion
3. **Field Testing**: Collecting and validating moisture test data from field technicians
4. **Analysis**: Processing test results and generating insights
5. **Reporting**: Creating professional reports and certifications for clients
6. **Workflow Management**: Orchestrating the movement of projects through different stages and personnel

## Problems Solved

The application solves several key business problems:

1. **Data Integrity**: Ensures accurate collection, storage, and analysis of moisture testing data
2. **Workflow Efficiency**: Coordinates work between sales, field technicians, analysts, and management
3. **Quality Assurance**: Enforces standardized testing procedures and report generation
4. **Client Communication**: Facilitates professional communication with clients through standardized reports
5. **Business Intelligence**: Provides insights into project status, testing results, and business metrics
6. **Compliance**: Ensures testing follows industry standards and maintains proper documentation

2. **Process Limitations**:
   - Manual steps required in several workflows
   - Limited integration with other business systems
   - Cumbersome report generation process
   - Data entry inefficiencies for complex forms

3. **Business Limitations**:
   - Difficult to add new testing methodologies
   - Limited ability to customize for specific client needs
   - Challenging to expand to new service offerings
   - Cost structure tied to traditional hosting model

## Market Context

The concrete moisture testing industry has specific needs that the application addresses:

1. **Industry Standards**: Follows ASTM and other industry standards for testing methodologies
2. **Certification Requirements**: Produces reports that meet industry certification needs
3. **Client Expectations**: Delivers professional reports that contractors and builders require
4. **Competitive Landscape**: Differentiates the business through quality and efficiency of service

## Future Vision

The AWS serverless migration opens opportunities for future enhancements:
