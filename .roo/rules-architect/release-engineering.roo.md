# IFTI Release Engineering Practices

This document outlines the release engineering practices for the IFTI project, focusing on AWS Amplify deployment practices aligned with the serverless architecture.

## Versioning Strategy

### Semantic Versioning

- **Format**: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g., 1.2.3)
  - **MAJOR**: Incompatible API changes
  - **MINOR**: Backward-compatible functionality additions
  - **PATCH**: Backward-compatible bug fixes

### Version Numbering Conventions

- **Development Versions**: 0.x.y for pre-production development
- **Release Candidates**: x.y.z-rc.n (e.g., 1.0.0-rc.1)
- **Beta Releases**: x.y.z-beta.n (e.g., 1.0.0-beta.1)
- **Alpha Releases**: x.y.z-alpha.n (e.g., 1.0.0-alpha.1)
- **Production Releases**: x.y.z (e.g., 1.0.0)

### Version Control

- **Git Tags**: Each release version is tagged in the repository
- **Branch Strategy**:
  - `main`: Production-ready code
  - `develop`: Integration branch for feature development
  - `feature/*`: Feature branches
  - `release/*`: Release preparation branches
  - `hotfix/*`: Emergency fixes for production

## Release Process Workflow

### Release Stages

1. **Planning**
   - Feature selection for the release
   - Version number assignment
   - Release timeline establishment

2. **Development**
   - Feature implementation in feature branches
   - Code reviews and unit testing
   - Integration into the develop branch

3. **Release Preparation**
   - Creation of release branch
   - Version bumping
   - Release notes preparation
   - Final QA testing

4. **Release Approval**
   - Stakeholder review
   - Final sign-off from product owner
   - Security review completion

5. **Deployment**
   - Staging environment deployment
   - Production deployment
   - Post-deployment verification

## Deployment Practices

### Environments

- **Development Environment**
  - Purpose: Active development and feature testing
  - Deployment: Automatic from feature branches
  - Data: Non-sensitive test data
  - Access: Development team only

- **Testing Environment**
  - Purpose: Integration testing and QA
  - Deployment: Automatic from develop branch
  - Data: Anonymized production-like data
  - Access: Development and QA teams

- **Staging Environment**
  - Purpose: Pre-production validation
  - Deployment: Manual from release branches
  - Data: Anonymized production clone
  - Access: Development, QA, and stakeholders

- **Production Environment**
  - Purpose: Live application
  - Deployment: Manual from main branch
  - Data: Production data
  - Access: Limited to DevOps team

### Environment Promotion

1. **Feature to Development**
   - Triggered by pull request merge to develop
   - Automated deployment via Amplify Console
   - Automated testing execution

2. **Development to Testing**
   - Scheduled daily builds
   - Requires passing development tests
   - Automated deployment with manual approval

3. **Testing to Staging**
   - Release branch creation
   - Manual deployment approval
   - Full regression testing

4. **Staging to Production**
   - Release approval process
   - Scheduled deployment window
   - Phased rollout strategy

## Rollback Procedures

### Failure Detection

- **Monitoring Thresholds**

  - Synthetic canary failures
  - User-reported issues

### Rollback Types

1. **Frontend Rollback**
   - Revert to previous build in Amplify Console
   - Update CDN distribution
   - Clear caches if necessary

2. **Backend Rollback**
   - Revert CloudFormation stack to previous state
   - Restore database from backup if necessary
   - Roll back Lambda function versions

3. **Database Rollback**
   - Point-in-time recovery for DynamoDB
   - Transaction rollback for in-progress operations
   - Data restoration from backups

### Rollback Process

1. **Decision Making**
   - Severity assessment
   - Impact evaluation
   - Rollback vs. fix-forward decision

2. **Execution**
   - Command execution by authorized personnel
   - Monitoring during rollback
   - Verification of system state

3. **Post-Rollback**
   - Incident documentation
   - Root cause analysis
   - Preventive measures implementation

## Branch Management Practices

### 1. Branch Naming Conventions

- Feature branches: `feature/{ticket-id}-{description}`
- Bugfix branches: `bugfix/{ticket-id}-{description}`
- Hotfix branches: `hotfix/{version}-{description}`
- Release branches: `release/{version}`
- Documentation branches: `docs/{description}`

### 2. Branch Creation Process

- Create branches from appropriate base branch:
  - Feature branches: from `develop`
  - Bugfix branches: from `develop`
  - Hotfix branches: from `main`
  - Release branches: from `develop`
  - Documentation branches: from `develop`

- ALWAYS create a branch for development work.
- Always connect branch to Jira ticket using ticket ID in name. Follow Jira management guideliness to create one, if a Jira ticket is not found.
- Always update Jira ticket status to "In Progress" when creating a branch

### 3. Branch Lifecycle Management

- Delete completed feature branches IMMEDIATELY after they are merged to the base branch
- When working in SOLO development mode, use `git branch -d <branch-name>` to delete the branch locally after merging
- When working in TEAM mode, both local and remote branches should be deleted after merge
- Regularly pull changes from base branch to avoid drift
- Before branching or merging, pull from remote in the base branch.
- Keep feature branches focused and short-lived
