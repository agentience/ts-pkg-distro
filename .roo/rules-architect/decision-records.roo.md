# IFTI Decision Records

This document captures architectural decision records (ADRs), alternatives considered, decision context, and impact analysis for the IFTI project.

## Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This section documents key architectural decisions made during the IFTI project development.

| ID | Title | Status | Date | Decision Maker(s) |
|----|-------|--------|------|------------------|
| ADR-001 | AWS Amplify as Backend Framework | Approved | TBD | TBD |
| ADR-002 | React for Frontend Development | Approved | TBD | TBD |
| ADR-003 | TypeScript for Type Safety | Approved | TBD | TBD |
| ADR-004 | Authentication Strategy | Proposed | TBD | TBD |
| ADR-005 | Data Storage Approach | Proposed | TBD | TBD |

## Alternatives Considered

This section documents alternatives that were considered for key architectural decisions and why they were not selected.

### ADR-001: AWS Amplify as Backend Framework
- **Alternative 1**: Firebase
  - Pros: Simpler setup, good for rapid prototyping
  - Cons: Less flexibility for complex data models, vendor lock-in
  - Reason not selected: Limited customization options for complex business rules

- **Alternative 2**: Custom Express.js Backend
  - Pros: Complete control over implementation, no vendor lock-in
  - Cons: Higher development effort, infrastructure management overhead
  - Reason not selected: Development timeline constraints, maintenance overhead

## Decision Context

This section provides the context in which architectural decisions were made, including business requirements, constraints, and assumptions.

### ADR-001: AWS Amplify as Backend Framework
- **Business Context**: Need for rapid development of a secure, scalable backend
- **Technical Context**: Team's familiarity with AWS services
- **Constraints**: Timeline for migration, budget considerations
- **Assumptions**: Growth in user base, need for scalability

## Impact Analysis

This section analyzes the impact of architectural decisions on various aspects of the project.

### ADR-001: AWS Amplify as Backend Framework
- **Development Impact**: Reduced backend development time, integrated authentication
- **Operational Impact**: Simplified deployment and scaling, managed infrastructure
- **Cost Impact**: Pay-as-you-go model, potential for cost optimization
- **Security Impact**: Built-in security features, compliance with AWS best practices
- **Maintenance Impact**: Reduced maintenance overhead, automatic updates
