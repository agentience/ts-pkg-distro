# IFTI Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing approaches, coverage goals, tools, and validation criteria for the IFTI project.

## Testing Approaches

This section defines the different testing approaches to be used throughout the IFTI project lifecycle.

### Unit Testing

- **Scope**: Individual functions, components, and modules
- **Responsibility**: Developers
- **Frequency**: During development, pre-commit
- **Automation**: Integrated with CI/CD pipeline
- **Isolation**: Mock external dependencies

### Integration Testing

- **Scope**: Interactions between components and services
- **Responsibility**: Developers and QA
- **Frequency**: After feature completion, pre-release
- **Automation**: Scheduled in CI/CD pipeline
- **Environment**: Staging environment with isolated data

### End-to-End Testing

- **Scope**: Complete user flows and scenarios
- **Responsibility**: QA team
- **Frequency**: Pre-release, regression testing
- **Automation**: Key flows automated, edge cases manual
- **Environment**: Production-like environment

### Performance Testing

- **Scope**: Response times, throughput, resource usage
- **Responsibility**: DevOps and QA
- **Frequency**: Pre-release, after significant changes
- **Benchmarks**: Define baseline metrics for key operations
- **Load Profiles**: Define typical and peak load scenarios

### Security Testing

- **Scope**: Authentication, authorization, data protection
- **Responsibility**: Security team
- **Frequency**: Pre-release, scheduled audits
- **Compliance**: Ensure adherence to security requirements
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular automated scans

## Coverage Goals

This section defines the test coverage goals for different types of testing.

### Unit Test Coverage

- **Code Coverage Target**: 80% overall, 90% for critical paths
- **Focus Areas**: Business logic, utility functions, state management
- **Exclusions**: Generated code, third-party libraries
- **Reporting**: Coverage reports generated with each build

### Integration Test Coverage

- **API Coverage**: 100% of endpoints tested
- **Service Interaction**: All service-to-service communications tested
- **Data Flow**: Verify data integrity across system boundaries
- **Error Handling**: Test error scenarios and recovery mechanisms

### End-to-End Test Coverage

- **User Journeys**: All critical user journeys covered
- **UI Components**: All interactive UI elements tested
- **Cross-browser**: Test on supported browsers and devices
- **Accessibility**: Test compliance with accessibility standards

## Testing Tools

This section outlines the tools to be used for different testing activities.

### Unit Testing Tools

- **Framework**: Jest for JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Mocking**: Jest mock functions, mock service worker
- **Coverage**: Istanbul/nyc for coverage reporting
- **UI Components**: React Testing Library

### Integration Testing Tools

- **API Testing**: Supertest, Postman
- **GraphQL Testing**: Apollo Client testing utilities
- **Database**: Test containers, in-memory databases
- **Service Virtualization**: Wiremock, Mockito

### End-to-End Testing Tools

- **Framework**: Cypress, Playwright
- **Visual Testing**: Percy, Applitools
- **Accessibility**: axe-core, Lighthouse
- **Reporting**: Custom dashboard, integration with CI/CD

### Performance Testing Tools

- **Load Testing**: k6, JMeter
- **Monitoring**: AWS CloudWatch, Prometheus
- **Profiling**: Chrome DevTools, Node.js profiler
- **Analysis**: Custom dashboards, trend analysis

## Validation Criteria

This section defines the criteria for validating test results and determining test success.

### Acceptance Criteria

- **Functional Requirements**: All specified functionality works as expected
- **Non-functional Requirements**: Performance, security, and usability meet defined standards
- **User Acceptance**: Stakeholder approval of key features
- **Regression**: No regression in existing functionality

### Quality Gates

- **Build Pipeline**: All unit tests pass, coverage meets targets
- **Deployment to Staging**: All integration tests pass
- **Production Release**: All end-to-end tests pass, performance meets SLAs
- **Post-Release**: Monitoring shows no unexpected behavior

### Defect Management

- **Severity Levels**: Define critical, major, minor defects
- **Resolution Criteria**: Requirements for closing defects
- **Tracking**: Process for logging, tracking, and verifying fixes
- **Metrics**: Defect density, fix rate, escape rate
