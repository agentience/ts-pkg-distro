# IFTI Integration Context

This document outlines the API contracts, integration points, data exchange formats, and testing approach for integrations within the IFTI project.

## API Contracts

This section defines the API contracts for both internal and external integrations.

### Internal API Contracts

- **Authentication API**
  - Endpoints: `/login`, `/logout`, `/refresh-token`
  - Request/Response formats
  - Authentication flow
  - Error handling

- **Data Management API**
  - Endpoints: `/data/{model}`, `/data/{model}/{id}`
  - CRUD operations
  - Filtering and pagination
  - Validation rules

- **Storage API**
  - Endpoints: `/storage/upload`, `/storage/download/{id}`
  - File upload/download flow
  - Metadata handling
  - Access control

### External API Contracts

- **Legacy System Integration**
  - Endpoints
  - Authentication mechanism
  - Data mapping
  - Rate limiting considerations

## Integration Points

This section identifies all integration points within the IFTI application architecture.

- **Frontend to Backend Integration**
  - React components to AWS Amplify services
  - State management to API calls
  - Error handling and retry mechanisms

- **Backend Service Integrations**
  - Auth service to Data service
  - Data service to Storage service
  - Event-driven communication between services

- **External System Integrations**
  - Legacy system data migration
  - Third-party service integrations
  - Webhook implementations

## Data Exchange Formats

This section defines the data formats used for exchanging information between system components.

- **JSON Schemas**
  - User profile schema
  - Document metadata schema
  - Configuration schema

- **GraphQL Types**
  - Query definitions
  - Mutation definitions
  - Subscription definitions

- **File Formats**
  - Document upload formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
  - Image formats and size limitations
  - Export formats

## Testing Approach

This section outlines the approach for testing integrations within the IFTI system.

- **Integration Testing Strategy**
  - Test coverage requirements
  - Test environment setup
  - Mocking external dependencies

- **API Testing**
  - Endpoint testing methodology
  - Authentication testing
  - Error case testing

- **End-to-End Testing**
  - User flow testing
  - Performance testing
  - Reliability testing

- **Monitoring and Observability**
  - Logging requirements
  - Metrics collection
  - Alerting thresholds
