## Recent Achievements

1. Completed comprehensive analysis of PostgreSQL database schema and application architecture
2. Designed target AWS serverless architecture with Amplify framework
3. Implemented initial Amplify infrastructure foundation
4. Fixed Amplify sandbox configuration issues
5. Enhanced GraphQL schema with comprehensive authentication directives
6. Implemented organization-based data isolation in all models
7. Added audit fields to all models
8. Created a new Organization model for multi-tenant support
9. Implemented role-based access control for all models
10. Finalized GraphQL schema with optimized @key directives for efficient querying
11. Designed single-table DynamoDB structure with carefully selected GSIs
12. Created ADR-005 documenting GraphQL schema and DynamoDB design decisions
13. Documented implementation guide for the finalized schema

## Known Issues

1. **DynamoDB Data Modeling**
   - Need to ensure all access patterns are efficiently supported by the defined indexes
   - Some complex queries may require custom resolvers
   - Performance testing needed with large datasets

2. **Business Logic Translation**
   - Moisture testing calculations need careful verification
   - Workflow state transitions need validation against existing logic
   - Form validation logic needs to be precisely migrated

3. **User Experience Transition**
   - Users will need training on the new interface
   - Some workflows may change in the new system
   - Mobile experience will be significantly different

4. **Integration Points**
   - Any external system integrations need to be identified
   - Email notifications need to be recreated
   - File/document migration requires careful planning

## Next Steps

1. Configure Amplify DataStore
2. Set up monitoring and logging
3. Create application-level RBAC structure in Cognito
4. Begin implementing custom resolvers
5. Develop service layer abstractions to hide index complexity
6. Implement pagination strategies for large datasets
7. Create performance testing framework
